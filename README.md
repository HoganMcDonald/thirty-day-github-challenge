# Thirty Day GitHub Challenge

1. Fork this repository
2. Use React to create a project that allows input of a GitHub username (e.g. lukeschlangen) and returns their:
  - Percentage of last 30 days with a contribution (green square)
  - Streak (number of days in a row) with a green square
3. I haven't solved this. It's a real problem I have. Don't know if a solution exists... good luck!

## Hard Mode

Allow a user to check starting from a specific day (not just today).
